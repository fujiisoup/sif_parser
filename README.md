sif_parser
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fujiisoup/sif_reader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fujiisoup/sif_reader)

> Install with `pip install sif_parser`

## Basic usage

A small package to read Andor Technology Multi-Channel files.

It provides the following methods,

### `sif_parser.np_open`

Read '.sif' file and return as a `np.ndarray` for image and an `OrderedDict` for metadata.

```python
>>> import sif_parser
>>> data, info = sif_parser.np_open('/path/to/file.sif')
>>> data
array([[[887.  , 881.25, 875.65, ..., 866.05, 870.  ],
        [905.6 , 872.7 , 900.7 , ..., 871.4 , 866.45],
        ...,
        [885.6 , 879.4 , 873.5 , ..., 883.6 , 877.  ],
        [879.4 , 873.  , 880.5 , ..., 881.  , 867.  ]]],
      dtype=float32)
>>> info
OrderedDict([('SifVersion', 65559),
             ('ExperimentTime', 1254330082),
             ('DetectorTemperature', -100.0),
             ...
            ])
```

If your calibration data is included in the file, this will be included as
`info['Calibration_data']` or `info['Calibration_data_for_frame_1']`.

### `sif_parser.xr_open('/path/to/file.sif')`:

> This method is only included if the `xarray` project is installed.
Read 'sif' file and return as a `xr.DataArray`.
The metadata is stored in `xr.DataArray.attrs`.
The calibration data and timestamps are stored as coordinates.

`xarray` is a very useful package to handle multi-dimensional arrays with metadata.
See [xarray project](http://xarray.pydata.org) for the details.

```python
>>> sif_parser.xr_open('testings/examples/image.sif')
<xarray.DataArray (Time: 1, height: 512, width: 512)>
array([[[887.  , 881.25, 875.65, ..., 866.05, 870.  ],
        [905.6 , 872.7 , 900.7 , ..., 871.4 , 866.45],
        [922.6 , 883.95, 899.  , ..., 864.6 , 864.8 ],
        ...,
        [880.65, 857.95, 883.55, ..., 866.  , 875.55],
        [885.6 , 879.4 , 873.5 , ..., 883.6 , 877.  ],
        [879.4 , 873.  , 880.5 , ..., 881.  , 867.  ]]],
      dtype=float32)
Coordinates:
  * Time     (Time) float64 0.0
Dimensions without coordinates: height, width
Attributes:
    SifVersion:            65559
    ExperimentTime:        1254330082
    DetectorTemperature:   -100.0
    ...
```

## Utils

### `sif_parser.utils.extract_calibration`
The `Calibration_data` entry of `info` contains coefficients of a cubic
polynomial used to calculate the wavelengths of an image.
To facilitate this `sif_parser.utils` contains the `extract_calibration`
function, which returns the wavelength of each pixel.

```python
data, info = sif_parser.np_open('path/to/file.sif')
wavelengths = sif_parser.utils.extract_calibration(info)
```

### `sif_parser.utils.parse`
Used to parse a .sif file into a 2 column numpy array as wavelengths and counts.

```python
import pandas as pd
import sif_parser


# parse the 'my_pl.sif' file
(data, info) = sif_parser.utils.parse('my_pl.sif')

# place data into a pandas Series
df = pd.Series(data[:, 1], index = data[:, 0])
```

## CLI

Installs a command line interface (CLI) named `sif_parser` that can be used to
convert .sif files to .csv.

Convert all .sif files in the current directory to .csv.
```bash
sif_parser
```

Convert all .sif files ending in `pl` in the current directly into a single .csv.
```bash
sif_parser --join *pl.sif
```

## Use as a plugin for PIL

**NOTE!!  The current version does not work as a plugin, maybe due to updates in PIL. Contributions are very welcome.**
See the issue [#7](https://github.com/fujiisoup/sif_reader/issues/7)

We also provide a plugin for PIL,

```python
from PIL import image
import sif_parser.plugin

I = Image.open('/path/to/file.sif')
```

Note that, however, it does not work for multiple-image files.
Contribution is very welcome!
The image mode is `'F'`, 32-bit floating-point greyscale.


## History

This plugin is originally developed by [soemraws](https://github.com/soemraws)
based on Marcel Leutenegger's MATLAB script.


## Current status

Andor has changed `sif` format for many times.
Although I have tested this package with as many kinds of `sif` files as I have
(the test suit is always checking the compatibility, as the badge above shows),
it might be still incompatible with your particular `sif` file.

If your file cannot be read by this script,
please raise an issue in github.
If you send me your file, I can add your file into the test suit
(I have a private repo in order to keep your sif file private).

Contribution is also very welcome.
